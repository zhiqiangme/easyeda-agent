// Daemon-level stale-read GATE (SKILL iron rule 5 made mechanical).
//
// After a PCB mutation (rip-up / route / delete / via / track / pour edits) the
// per-document engine state serves STALE data to list/DRC reads until the
// document is reloaded (`easyeda doc reload`) — observed repeatedly on real
// boards. Until now this was enforced only by the agent remembering rule 5,
// helped along by a non-blocking `staleRisk` advisory this guard attached to the
// response.
//
// ── Why the advisory became a REFUSAL ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// A 49-day audit review (171554 action records under ~/.easyeda-agent/audit)
// measured how often each iron rule is actually obeyed, and rule 5 was the only
// one bleeding: **1780 stale PCB reads, an 18.1% violation rate**. Every one of
// those reads got the advisory on stderr and read on anyway. The rules that
// never leak (the 14-stage gate, the page/zone gate) are the ones a machine
// REFUSES, not the ones the prose asks nicely for — so this guard now refuses
// too. The advisory is still attached (see observe), but a bare stale read no
// longer returns data: it returns a `STALE_READ` error naming the mutation that
// dirtied the window and the exact command that fixes it.
//
// The refusal lives at the dispatch choke point (checkStaleRead, called from
// handleAction next to the stage gate), so a raw /action caller can't slip past
// the CLI. `forceReason` is the audited escape hatch.
//
// State machine (per windowId, in-memory):
//   SET    — a PCB-domain action with Mutates=true succeeds (catalog-driven,
//            same source of truth as autosave), except the exempt sets below.
//   CLEAR  — a `doc reload` completes. Reload is a CLI composite (save → close
//            via debug.exec_js closeDocument → reopen), so the daemon keys on
//            its unique discriminator: a successful debug.exec_js whose code
//            calls closeDocument (a real close resets the per-doc engine
//            state; a mere `doc switch`/document.open does NOT and must not
//            clear). pcb.pour.rebuild also clears — it recomputes the pour
//            connectivity that goes stale (pour-mediated Connection Errors).
//   BLOCK  — a PCB-domain read (Mutates=false) arrives while the flag is set:
//            refused with STALE_READ unless it carries a forceReason, or is in
//            the narrow staleBlockExemptReads set (still advisory-only).
//
// Exemptions (never SET the flag) — the first three are scar tissue, do not
// remove them:
//   - pcb.save: saving changes no copper; the daemon's debounced autosave also
//     bypasses /action entirely (dispatchSave), so neither path false-flags.
//   - pcb.pour.rebuild: it is the FIX for stale pour connectivity, not a new
//     hazard — it clears instead.
//   - any request carrying `dryRun:true`: the catalog's Mutates flag is
//     action-name granular and cannot see that a preview enumerates without
//     touching the board. `pcb clear --dry-run` used to arm the flag and make
//     every later read cry stale on an untouched board (issue #112).
//   - view-only editor state (staleViewOnlyActions): added when the advisory
//     became a refusal, because a false positive now costs a failed command
//     instead of a stderr line. See that var for the argument.
//
// windowIds churn on reconnect; a reconnected window starts clean (a window
// reload re-reads the saved document, which is exactly the stale-fix), so
// per-window in-memory state is the right lifetime.

// staleExemptActions never mark the window stale even though the catalog says
// Mutates=true (see package comment).

// EDITOR SHOWS — the viewed side, the active layer, layer visibility — and never
// a primitive an enumeration reads back. They cannot make a later read stale, so
// they must not arm the flag.
//
// This was tolerable while the guard only annotated; as a refusal it would be a
// guaranteed false positive, because the action catalog itself prescribes the
// mutate→read sequence these would break: pcb.view.side declares
// VerifyWith=[pcb.layers.list, pcb.snapshot] and pcb.layers.set_current declares

// index — it is the cheapest way for an agent to SEE whether a write landed, and
// refusing it removes the eye rather than the hazard. (2) When a snapshot IS
// wrong it is wrong for a different reason with a different fix: a blank/stale
// FRAME is cured by bringing the window to the foreground, not by `doc reload`
// (memory: snapshot-blank-vs-stale-foreground). Refusing it would hand the
